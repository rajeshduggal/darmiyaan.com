## Aditi
43. Editor at a small literary press in Toronto. Married to Rohit, two kids - Meha and Arjun.
## Akash
45. Senior VP at a cargo company in Singapore. Married to Brinda - one daughter Saira.

Itâ€™s been more than twenty years since Aditi and Akash dated, and lost touch with each other. After reconnecting one day, they plan to meet each other in Delhi -- and spend half a day walking down Delhi and their own memory lanes.
